- missing vegetables

Nice Features
===
- zombie player
- statistics (final deck contents per type?, perhaps played cards per type?)
- HTML pages:

Topics
===
- translations
- more auto play?
  - auto pass if no playable cards left? in general, hard, but perhaps for artichoke-only hands
- game progression

Cleanups
===
- remove console logs and debug logging
- debug animation issues
  - when moving from visible to visible
- onion when auto-choosing opponent moves from hand to played card and disappears, and hand to other player,
  probably because both animations start at the same time; same for beet, possibly others
