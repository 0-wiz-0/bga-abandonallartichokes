Cleanups/Bugs
===
- remove console logs and debug logging
- debug animation issues
  - when moving from visible to visible
  - onion when auto-choosing opponent moves from hand to played card and disappears, and hand to other player,
    probably because both animations start at the same time; same for beet, possibly others
- play log reduction
  - combine
- just visible in log who selects who
- names for areas
- white line on iPad at bottom of cards
- skip harvest if garden row is empty
- artichoke count wrong in statistics if we received artichokes/passed artichokes
