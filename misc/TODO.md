Cleanups/Bugs
===
- debug animation issues
  - when moving from visible to visible, cards are moved, then their
    shadows are removed from where they were before
  - when potato/broccoli is played, for spectator, the card moves
    to played area then fades out, instead of two animations

Comments from players
===
- you can only see in the log who selects who
- names for areas might be helpful
- If there are <= 2 cards in my hand, automatically select those as
  the cards to pass
- The positioning is not what I expected based on other BGA games. I
  expect my hand at the top, with the garden/common area below.
